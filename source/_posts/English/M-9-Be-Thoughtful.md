summary: Be Thoughtful

## 课文

Being thoughtful simply means thinking of others before yourself. What you say or do will have an effect on others. So it is important that you think before you say or do anything. In this way, you can avoid hurting others' feelings. Moreover, a thoughtless act or remark can spoil a perfect relationship.

Remember these rules. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything. Likewise, if you think what you do will hurt others, don't do it. After all, what goes around comes around. (种什么因，得什么果。)
