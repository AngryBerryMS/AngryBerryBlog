summary: He Who Hesitates Is Lost
---


## 对话

Mike is in Vienna with his girlfriend Daisy.

**M:** Are you having a good time, Daisy?

**D:** Are you kidding? I'm having the time of my life. I loved the concerts.

**M:** Concert going is fantastic but what else can we do?

**D:** Biking along the banks of the river Danube (/ˈdænjuːb/多瑙河) could be fun.

**M:** It sounds like a great idea!

**D:** Let's do it then.

**M:** You're right. As they say, "He who hesitates is lost." (迟疑者将丧失良机。犹豫就会败北！🤭)
