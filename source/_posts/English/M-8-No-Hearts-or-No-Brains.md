## 对话

Helen and Dick are talking about the previous article.

**H:** I don't understand how people can think Dr. Kevorkian is doing the right thing.

**D:** Well, helping people die with dignity is not that bad, is it?

**H:** Don't you know? Where there is life, there is hope. （留得青山在，不怕没柴烧。）

**D:** Come on. Be realistic. Those people who want to die are suffering. It's better that they go quickly and painlessly.

**H:** All you men have no hearts.

**D:** And all you women have no brains.
