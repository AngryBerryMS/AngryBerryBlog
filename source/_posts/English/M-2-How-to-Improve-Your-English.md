Mack is talking to his friend Don.

**M:** Hi, Don! How are you doing in your English class?

**D:** Not so well, I'm afraid.

**M:** What's the problem?

**D:** I'm not improving. Tell me, how come your English is so good?

**M:** Well, uh...I have an American girlfriend.

**D:** Aha! That's it. Now I know what to do. (He runs off.)

**M:** Hey, come back! I was just kidding!
