summary: Power Without Pollution
---

## 课文

Pollution is a big problem in almost all the big cities of the world. City people are, therefore, becoming more and more worried about how they can get rid of pollution. They are also concerned about whether the government is doing enough to protect the environment.

However, people in Ireland don't have these worries. They are sure that they have found the answer to the problem. They use windmills (风车). These windmills can create power without creating pollution. This method id so successful that other countries are thinking of doing the same. Why not? What works for Ireland can work for any other country.
