summary: The City of Song
---

## 课文

Listening to music is the favorite pastime of many people all over the world. This is especially true for people living in Vienna (维也纳), the city of song. Being the home of Mozart, this city is the birthplace of classical music and the waltz (华尔兹舞曲，圆舞曲).

Music fills the air in Vienna. Going to public concerts is often free of charge. And don't forget, Vienna is also home to the world famous Vienne Boys' Choir (维也纳少年合唱团). No wonder people say Austria (奥地利) is always alive with the sound of music.
