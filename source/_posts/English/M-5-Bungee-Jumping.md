summary: Bungee Jumping

## 课文

Bungee jumping looks like fun, It makes me nervous just to watch someone do it. It certainly takes a lot of guts to jump one thousand feet about the water with only a rope tied to your legs. It scares me just to think about it. However, it is something I really want to do one day.

Some people think I'm crazy. They say to jump is foolish enough, but to have to pay for it is madness. I don't agree. For me, to live a short and exciting life is far better than to live a long and boring one. What do you think?
