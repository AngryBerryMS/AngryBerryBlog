---

## 对话

Jane meets her old friend, Fred.

**J:** Hi, Fred! How's everything?

**F:** Not so good, I'm afraid. Supporting a family is becoming more and more difficult these days.

**J:** What you say can't be more true. Everything is so expensive. I can hardly make ends meet myself.

**F:** Oh, really? Do you need any money? What I have is not much, but I can loan you some.

**J:** I'm OK. Thanks for being so thoughtful anyway.

**F:** What are friend for?(要不然要朋友干嘛？)
