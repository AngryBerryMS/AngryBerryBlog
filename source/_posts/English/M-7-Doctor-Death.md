summary: Doctor Death (死亡医生)
---

## 课文

Whether very sick people should be helped to end their own lives is a question many people cannot answer. However, Dr. Kevorkian is an exception. That he has done this more than twenty times is known to everyone. Some say what he is doing is immoral (不道德的). They call him Doctor Death. Others say what he is doing is merciful (仁慈的). They call him mercy killing (安乐死).

Whether Dr. Kevorkian should be allowed to continue doing this is a real problem for the government. There seem to be two sides to the argument. Which side are you on?
